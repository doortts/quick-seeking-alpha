**Last updated:** 2025-10-23

Seeking Alpha Link Modifier (“the Extension”) does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.  
This document explains what information the extension handles and its limited scope.

## 1. Data Collection and Use
- The extension does **not** transmit any user data to developers or third parties.
- It only stores user-defined link modification patterns in the browser’s **local storage**.
- This data stays entirely within the user’s browser; developers have no access to it.

## 2. Permissions Used
- **“storage” permission** — used solely to save user-defined link modification patterns locally,  
  so that settings persist when the browser is closed or restarted.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Tracking
- The extension does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
- No network requests are made to transmit user data externally.

## 4. Data Deletion
- All locally stored data is automatically removed when the user uninstalls the extension or clears browser data.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
- This extension is not intended for children and does not knowingly collect data from minors.
